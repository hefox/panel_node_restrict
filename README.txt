Panel node restrict serves two related functionality, both with the purpose of 
restricting access to panel content.

First it changes permissions on panel related node paths.
Second is can share one panel content/layout among a translated node 
  Ie. for a panel node 1 english, tha has french translation node 2, 
  node 2 will also use the panel content settings of node 1.

Another extra is a setting to pick a default layout when creating panel nodes so
 the panel layout selection screen can be bypassed.
